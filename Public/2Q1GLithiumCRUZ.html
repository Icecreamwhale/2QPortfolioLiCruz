<h1>Spinosaurus, Largest Semiaquatic Carnivore</h1>

  <p>Spinosaurus, genus of theropod dinosaurs belonging to the family Spinosauridae,  or “spined reptile,” 
    was named for its “sail back” feature, created by tall vertebral spines.</p>

<h1> Discovery </h1>

<section>
<p> It was named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915 on the basis of the discovery 
    of a partial skeleton from Bahariya Oasis in western Egypt by his assistant Richard Markgraf. 
    These fossils were destroyed in April 1944 when British aircraft 
    inadvertently bombed the museum in Munich in which they were housed. For several decades 
    Spinosaurus was known only from Stromer's monographic descriptions; however, additional 
    fragmentary remains were discovered during the 1990s and 2000s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. 
    Related taxa in the family Spinosauridae include Baryonyx from England, Irritator from Brazil, 
    and Suchomimus from Niger. </p>
