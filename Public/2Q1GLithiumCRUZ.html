<h1>Spinosaurus, Largest Semiaquatic Carnivore</h1>

  <p>Spinosaurus, genus of theropod dinosaurs belonging to the family Spinosauridae,  or “spined reptile,” 
    was named for its “sail back” feature, created by tall vertebral spines.</p>

<h1> Discovery </h1>

<section>
<p> It was named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915 on the basis of the discovery 
    of a partial skeleton from Bahariya Oasis in western Egypt by his assistant Richard Markgraf. 
    These fossils were destroyed in April 1944 when British aircraft 
    inadvertently bombed the museum in Munich in which they were housed. For several decades 
    Spinosaurus was known only from Stromer's monographic descriptions; however, additional 
    fragmentary remains were discovered during the 1990s and 2000s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. 
    Related taxa in the family Spinosauridae include Baryonyx from England, Irritator from Brazil, 
    and Suchomimus from Niger. </p>

 <h1> Details </h1>
<p> Like other spinosaurids, Spinosaurus possessed a long narrow skull resembling that of a crocodile and nostrils near the eyes, 
  instead of near the end of the snout. Its teeth were straight and conical, instead of curved and bladelike as in other theropods. 
  All these features are adaptations for piscivory (that is, the consumption of fish). In addition, early studies posited that the 
  bones of its skeleton were more compact and denser than those of similar land-dwelling theropods, which allowed it greater control
   over its buoyancy underwater; this characteristic led some researchers to argue that Spinosaurus was primarily an aquatic predator 
   rather than a terrestrial one. However, later modeling studies and fossil evidence suggested that although Spinosaurus could swim,
    it did not have dense bones, which limited its ability to swim, and it was a bipedal terrestrial predator. Other spinosaurids have 
    been found with partially digested fish scales and the bones of other dinosaurs in their stomach regions, and spinosaurid teeth have 
    been found embedded in pterosaur bones. The sail over the animal’s back was probably used for social displays or species recognition 
    rather than for temperature regulation. Some authorities maintain that the sail was actually a hump used to store water and lipids.</p>
